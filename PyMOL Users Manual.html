<H1><A NAME="6">Getting Started with Commands</A></H1>
<P> This section steps through a typical PyMOL session, introducing
 typed commands and describing how PyMOL responds to them. The details
 of command syntax are in the section titled &quot;PyMOL Command Language.&quot;</P>
<P> The PyMOL language is case-sensitive, but upper case is not used in
 the current package. So just remember to type all your commands in
 lower case.</P>
<H2><A NAME="6_1">Recording Your Work (Optional)</A></H2>
<P> While you are learning PyMOL or doing complex projects, you may want
 to keep a record of all the commands you give in a plain text log-file
 that you can read and edit. To open a log-file, type the command<B>
 log_open</B> followed by a file-name:</P>
<PRE>   
SYNTAX
   
   log_open <I>log-file-name</I>
      			
EXAMPLE
   
   <B>PyMOL&gt;</B> log_open log1.pml 			
</PRE>
<P> All your commands, typed or clicked, will be recorded in the
 log-file. You should give your<I> log-file-name</I> the extension
 &quot;.pml&quot; so you can load the file as a script, to repeat your commands in
 a new session (see the subsection titled &quot;Sessions and Scripts&quot; below).</P>
<P> To stop recording your commands, type<B> log_close</B>. If you don't
 type<B> log_close</B> before you exit PyMOL, your log-file will still
 be saved to disk.</P>
<P> If you just want to save the current state of your PyMOL work
 without concern for the steps you took and the commands you gave, you
 can create a session-file (see &quot;Sessions and Scripts&quot;).</P>
<H2><A NAME="6_2">Loading Data</A></H2>
 Next you need to input your data from a file, say atomic coordinates in
 PDB format:
<PRE>   
SYNTAX
   
   load <I>data-file-name</I>
      			
EXAMPLE
   
   <B>PyMOL&gt;</B> load $PYMOL_PATH/test/dat/pept.pdb 			
</PRE>
 Given this command, PyMOL will open and read the file &quot;pept.pdb,&quot;
 create and name a corresponding object, display a representation of the
 object in the viewer, and add the object's name to the control panel.
<P>By default, PyMOL names the object after the file it read. You can
 assign a different name to the object by typing the name in the command
 line:</P>
<PRE>
SYNTAX
   
   load <I>data-file-name, object-name</I>	
      
EXAMPLES 
   
   <B>PyMOL&gt;</B> load $PYMOL_PATH/test/dat/pept.pdb        # The object is named &quot;pept&quot;. 
                                                    # PyMOL doesn't use  
                                                    # the file-name extension
                                                    # &quot;.pdb&quot; in the object-name.  
                                                      
   <B>PyMOL&gt;</B> load $PYMOL_PATH/test/dat/pept.pdb, test  # The object is named &quot;test&quot;.
</PRE>
 (Note that &quot;#&quot; is a comment character, so anything you type to the
 right of &quot;#&quot; in a command line is not interpreted by PyMOL.)
<P> The command for loading a file follows typical PyMOL syntax.<B> load</B>
 is a<I> keyword</I>; it calls PyMOL to perform a certain function.<I>
 data-file-name</I> and<I> object-name</I> are arguments to<B> load</B>.
 These arguments tell PyMOL what file to load and what to name it, but
 in general, arguments to keywords just supply information that PyMOL
 needs to carry out commands.</P>
<H2><A NAME="6_3">Manipulating Objects</A></H2>
<P>After PyMOL creates an object, you can manipulate it in the view
 window and control panel with your mouse, and also by typing commands.
 For example, you can change from the default representation, called<B>
 lines</B>, to the more hefty<B> sticks</B>. First get rid of the<B>
 lines</B> and then show the<B> sticks</B>:</P>
<PRE>
SYNTAX
   
   hide <I>representation</I> 
      
   show <I>representation</I>
      	
EXAMPLES
   
   <B>PyMOL&gt;</B> hide lines       # The object shown in lines disappears from view. 
      
   <B>PyMOL&gt;</B> show sticks      # The object is represented as sticks in the viewer.
</PRE>
 Other representations are<B> cartoon</B>s,<B> ribbon</B>s,<B> dots</B>,<B>
 spheres</B>,<B> surface</B>s, and<B> mesh</B>es (See the Section titled
 &quot;Representations&quot;).
<H3><A NAME="6_3_1">Atom Selections</A></H3>
<P> If you want to manipulate a subset of the atoms and bonds in a
 molecule, you can use<I> atom selections.</I> PyMOL is pretty
 sophisticated when it comes to selecting, grouping and naming groups of
 atoms. For example, you can select particular residues or atoms in a
 binding pocket, or a hydrophobic patch, or all the alanines in a helix,
 and so on. The Section titled &quot;PyMOL Command Language&quot; gives the
 details for selecting interesting groups of atoms.</P>
<P> You can use a selection just once, or you can name it to make it
 easier to use again later. For example, you can zoom in on a selection
 &quot;on the fly:&quot;</P>
<PRE>
SYNTAX
   
   zoom <I>selection-expression</I>    # Select the atoms just for zooming.
      
EXAMPLE 
   
   <B>PyMOL&gt;</B> zoom resi 1-10        # The <I>selector</I> <B>resi</B> 
                                # chooses amino acid residues 
                                # given by the PDB sequence number 
                                # <I>identifier</I> &quot;1-10.&quot;   
</PRE>
<I> Selection-expression</I>s range from single words to long
 complicated expressions. An<I> object-name</I> may be a<I>
 selection-expression</I>. The default<I> selection-expression</I> is<B>
 all</B>, which refers to all the atoms that are currently loaded. If a<I>
 selection-expression</I> is missing, PyMOL will apply the command to<B>
 all</B>. We'll keep our<I> selection-expression</I>s short in this
 section.
<P> If you name the selection, you will be able to manipulate it any
 number of times. Object and selection names may include the upper or
 lower case characters (A/a to Z/z), numerals (0 to 9), and the
 underscore character (_). Characters to avoid include:</P>
<PRE>
! @ # $ % ^ &amp;* ( ) ' &quot; [ ] { } \ | ~ ` &lt;&gt; . ? / 
</PRE>
<P> First, name the selection:</P>
<PRE>
SYNTAX
   
   select <I>selection-name, selection-expression</I>   
  
EXAMPLES 
      
   <B>PyMOL&gt;</B> select akeeper, resi 1-10    # Select the residues and name them &quot;akeeper.&quot;
                                      
</PRE>
 Then use it:
<PRE>
SYNTAX
         
   zoom <I>selection-name</I>
      
   hide <I>representation, selection-name</I>
      	
   show <I>representation, selection-name</I>
      
EXAMPLES 
   
   <B>PyMOL&gt;</B> zoom akeeper                 # Zoom in on them in the viewer.
   
   <B>PyMOL&gt;</B> hide everything, akeeper     # Hide their representation in the viewer.
                                                          
   <B>PyMOL&gt;</B> show spheres, akeeper        # Show them in a different representation,
                                       # spheres, this time.
</PRE>
<P> When you create a<I> selection-name,</I> PyMOL puts it in the
 control panel so you can apply control panel functions to the selection
 using your mouse (See the section titled &quot;PyMOL Command Language&quot;).</P>
<P> Named-selections such as &quot;akeeper&quot; are manipulated like PyMOL
 objects, but objects and named-selections are fundamentally different.
 PyMOL creates an<I> object-name</I> to locate data when you load a data
 file. Making selections is a way of pointing to a subset of that data.
 To distinguish<I> selection-name</I>s from<I> object-name</I>s,<I>
 selection-name</I>s are shown inside parentheses in the control panel.</P>
<P> When you delete a<I> selection-name</I>, the data are still found
 under the<I> object-name</I>, but the data are no longer organized as
 the selection. In contrast, after you delete an object, you must reload
 the data to have access to it again.</P>
<PRE>
SYNTAX
      
   delete <I>selection-name</I> 
      	
   delete <I>object-name</I>
      
EXAMPLES 
   
   <B>PyMOL&gt;</B> delete akeeper              # &quot;akeeper&quot; is gone, but the object remains.  
      	
   <B>PyMOL&gt;</B> delete pept                 # The atoms and bonds in &quot;pept&quot; are gone.
</PRE>
<H3><A NAME="6_3_2">Coloring Objects and Selections</A></H3>
<P> You can apply various colors to selections and objects using typed
 commands. Predefined<I> color-name</I>s are listed under the
 settings/colors pull-down menu. Many of them can be chosen from the
 control panel. See the section titled &quot;Settings&quot; to find out how to
 define more colors.</P>
<PRE>
SYNTAX
      
   color <I>color-name</I>                    # All the representations of
                                       # loaded objects are colored.    
      
   color <I>color-name, selection-expression</I>       # The representation of
                                                # the selection is colored.   

EXAMPLES 
   
   <B>PyMOL&gt;</B> color white                  # Everything turns white. 
                                       # This looks fine on the
                                       # default black background, 
                                       # but causes disappearance
                                       # if you've changed the background to white.
                                                
   <B>PyMOL&gt;</B> color orange, pept           # Remember that &quot;pept&quot; is our <I>object-name</I>,
                                       # so the entire object is colored orange.
      
   <B>PyMOL&gt;</B> color green, resi 50+54+58   # The representation of

</PRE>
<P> In the last three examples, the<I> selector</I><B> ss</B> chooses
 secondary structures specified by<B> h</B> for helix,<B> s</B> for beta
 sheet strand and<B> l+&quot;&quot;</B> for loops and unspecified structures.</P>
<H3><A NAME="6_3_3">Turning Objects and Selections On and Off</A></H3>
<P> PyMOL can hold several objects in memory at the same time. The
 commands<B> disable</B> and<B> enable</B> allow you to eliminate
 representations of objects from the viewer while still controlling
 their properties with commands.</P>
<PRE>
SYNTAX
      
   enable <I>object-name</I> 
               
EXAMPLE

   <B>PyMOL&gt;</B> load $PYMOL_PATH/test/dat/fc.pdb

</PRE>
<P> You can also use the<B> disable</B> command to get rid of the pink
 dots that identify the last-named selection in the viewer:</P>
<PRE>
SYNTAX
      
   enable <I>selection-name</I> 
               
   
EXAMPLE

   <B>PyMOL&gt;</B> select bb, name c+o+n+ca     # Atoms included in the

</PRE>
 You can still operate on the representations of objects that are
 disabled, even with the commands<B> show</B> and<B> hide</B>. The
 results will be apparent when you subsequently<B> enable</B> the
 object.
<H2><A NAME="6_4"> Changing Your Point of View</A></H2>
<P> Dragging on a molecule with the mouse is often the easiest way to
 manouver, but typed commands such as<B> zoom</B> and<B> orient</B> give
 you a different form of control, allowing computations to direct the
 view.<B> zoom</B>, as the name suggests, brings an object or selection
 close up in the center of the field of view. If the object or selection
 doesn't fit in the current view, the view opens out to include it. If
 it is just a small part of the current view, the view closes in to fill
 more of the screen with it.</P>
<PRE>
SYNTAX
      
   zoom <I>selection-expression</I>        # The &quot;camera&quot; moves close                                        
                                    # to the selection so it fills the viewer,
                                    # or moves further away to include
                                    # all of the selection in the viewer 
</PRE>
<P><B> orient</B> is a useful command when you want a fresh start in
 viewing the molecule. It aligns the object or selection so its largest
 dimension is shown horizontally, and its second largest dimension is
 shown vertically.</P>
<PRE>
SYNTAX
      
   orient <I>selection-expression</I>      # The selection is aligned 
                                    # for maximum visibility in the viewer.  
</PRE>
<P> You can store orientations and recall them later in your PyMOL
 session using the command<B> view.</B> Storing a view only saves the
 viewpoint on the objects in the viewer. It does not save their
 representation. To store a view for later in the session, you need to
 &quot;key&quot; it, that is, to give a name or number as an argument to the
 command<B> view</B>. A second argument tells PyMOL whether you want it
 to store the view or recall it.</P>
<PRE>
SYNTAX
      
   view <I>key, action</I>           # The possible actions are <B>store</B> and <B>recall</B>.     
      
EXAMPLES 
   
   <B>PyMOL&gt;</B> view v1, store      # The current view is named &quot;v1&quot; and stored.

   <B>PyMOL&gt;</B> view v1, recall     # The view keyed &quot;v1&quot; is restored.  
                                               
   <B>PyMOL&gt;</B> view v1             # <B>recall</B> is the default argument to <B>view</B>,
                              # so this also recalls &quot;v1.&quot;                                        
</PRE>
<P> The keyword<B> view</B> only stores an orientation for the duration
 of the current PyMOL session. The next section gives the recipe for
 saving and restoring views in different PyMOL sessions.</P>
<H2><A NAME="6_5">Saving Your Work</A></H2>
<P> PyMOL saves your work in f kinds of processes: (1) Before you give a
 series of commands, you can initiate the process of logging your
 commands into plain text log-files that can later be used as scripts.
 (2) At any point in a PyMOL session you can save the memory state of
 the program by creating a session file that can later be loaded to
 restore that memory state. (3) You can write a graphics file to store
 the image you have created in the viewer for sharing or publication.</P>
<H3><A NAME="6_5_1">Scripts and Log Files</A></H3>
<P> A PyMOL script is just a text file, such as a log-file, containing
 typed PyMOL commands separated by carriage returns. When a script is
 loaded into PyMOL the commands it contains are executed. PyMOL expects
 scripts to have &quot;.pml&quot; file-name extensions (this is not strictly
 required, but it is good practice).</P>
<P> You can use log-files as scripts, and you can create scripts in a
 text editor such as<B> emacs</B>,<B> jot</B>, or<B> notepad</B>. It's
 often useful to keep a text editor open in a separate window while
 using PyMOL. Commands can then be cut and pasted between the two
 programs.</P>
<P> You can open a new log-file by typing<B> log_open</B><I>
 log-file-name</I>, or by clicking on &quot;log&quot; under the &quot;File&quot; menu and
 naming the log-file in the dialog box. You can also append commands to
 an existing log-file by choosing &quot;append&quot; or &quot;resume&quot; in the &quot;File&quot;
 menu. When you &quot;resume&quot; rather than &quot;append,&quot; the existing log-file is
 first loaded as a script, and then subsequent commands are written to
 it.</P>
<P> Once you have opened a log-file in any of these ways, PyMOL will
 write and save all your commands, whether they are typed or given by
 clicking on the buttons in the GUI.</P>
 However, to store the orientation of a molecule into a log-file, you
 need to give the command<B> get_view</B> (type it or use the GUI
 button). You may find it convenient to<B> get_view</B> several times in
 a PyMOL session, and then edit the log-file to select the most useful
 views.
<P> Scripts can be executed in several ways. Under Windows, scripts can
 be run in a new PyMOL session by double clicking on the script's icon.
 Alternatively, you can run a script using the &quot;File&quot; menu's &quot;Run&quot;
 option. PyMOL also understands &quot;<B>@</B>&quot; as the typed command that
 loads a script:</P>
<PRE>   
SYNTAX

   @<I>script-file-name</I>

EXAMPLE

   <B>PyMOL&gt;</B> @my_script.pml
</PRE>
<P> You can also include the<I> script-file-name</I> when launching
 PyMOL from a command line:</P>
<PRE>   
SYNTAX

   pymol <I>script-file-name</I>

EXAMPLE (Windows)

   <B>C:\&gt;</B> pymol.exe my_script.pml

EXAMPLE (Unix)

   <B>unix&gt;</B> ./pymol.com my_script.pml 
</PRE>
<H3><A NAME="6_5_2">png Files</A></H3>
<P> Once you are satisfied with the representation and orientation of
 your molecule, you may want to save the image in a graphics file.
 Before you do that, you can improve the quality of the graphics by
 switching from PyMOL's fast default graphics engine, OpenGL, to its ray
 tracer. The ray tracer is slower, but produces higher quality
 renderings for display and publication. Ray tracing shows how light is
 reflected and how shadows fall in a three-dimensional world. Ray
 tracing may take some minutes for a large complex object. The keyword<B>
 ray</B> calls PyMOL's raytracer to redraw and display the image in the
 view window (See the section titled &quot;Ray Tracing&quot; for more details).</P>
<P> To save an image to a file, raytraced or not, use the &quot;Save Image&quot;
 option in the &quot;File&quot; menu or type the<B> png</B> command:</P>
<PRE>   
SYNTAX

   png <I>file-name</I>

EXAMPLE

   <B>PyMOL&gt;</B>  png $PYMOL_PATH/pep    # The file-name extension &quot;.jpeg&quot; is 
                                  # added. The image file &quot;pep.jpeg&quot; is stored 
                                  # in a path below the PyMOL installation.
</PRE>
 The PNG file format is directly readable by PowerPoint. It can be
 converted into other formats using a package like ImageMagick.
<H3><A NAME="6_5_3">Session Files</A></H3>
<P> If you want to be able to return to the current state of PyMOL, then
 you can create a session-file (Choose &quot;Save Session&quot; in the &quot;File&quot; menu
 and respond to the dialog box by naming the file with a &quot;.pse&quot;
 file-name extension). This utility works like the &quot;Save&quot; utility in a
 word processing program. A PyMOL session-file is a symbolic record of
 the state of PyMOL's memory, including the the objects that have been
 loaded or created, the named-selections that have been created, and the
 display in the viewer.</P>
<P> When you open the saved session-file, PyMOL's memory returns to the
 state that was saved. Because a session-file represents a PyMOL memory
 state, opening one means that you are eliminating everything that you
 currently have in PyMOL's memory, and replacing it with the memory
 state from the session-file.</P>
<P> A session-file differs from a log-file or a script in a number of
 ways. You have to open a log-file before you give the commands you want
 to save, but a session-file can be created at any point. A session-file
 is invoked by choosing &quot;open&quot; under the file menu, while a log-file is
 &quot;run&quot; as a script. Also, you can't write or edit session-files, as you
 can log-files and scripts.</P>
<P> It's a good idea to create session-files at strategic points in
 PyMOL sessions, for example, when you decide to explore one of several
 options. In this way, session-files can be used to replace an &quot;undo&quot;
 utility, which PyMOL lacks. You can store any number of PyMOL states in
 successive session-files, and revert to them, effectively &quot;undo&quot;-ing
 the work you did since creating the session-file.</P>
<H2><A NAME="6_6">Command-Line Shortcuts</A></H2>
<P>Since almost nobody likes to type, PyMOL's command-line interface
 includes several &quot;shortcut&quot; features designed to reduce typing. If you
 are a unix user, you will recognize the similarity with features found
 in tcsh or bash.</P>
<H3><A NAME="6_6_1">Command Completion using TAB</A></H3>
<P>If you type the first few characters of a command and then hit TAB,
 PyMOL will either complete the command or print out a list of which
 commands match the command.</P>
<PRE> 
EXAMPLE
  
   <B>PyMOL&gt;</B> sel 
       
   # hitting TAB will produce 
   
   <B>PyMOL&gt;</B> select
   </PRE>
<P>If you hit the TAB key on a blank command line, PyMOL will output a
 list of its commands.</P>
<H3><A NAME="6_6_2">Filename Completion using TAB</A></H3>
<P> Some of the files you need to load into PyMOL may have long paths
 and filenames. PyMOL makes it easier to load such files by
 automatically completing unambiguous paths and filenames when you hit
 the TAB key. For instance,</P>
<PRE>
EXAMPLE 
 
   <B>PyMOL&gt;</B> load cry 
     
   # If &quot;crystal.pdb&quot; exists in the current directory, hitting TAB will generate
    
   <B>PyMOL&gt;</B> load cystal.pdb          
</PRE>
<P>If there is some ambiguity in the filename, PyMOL will complete the
 name up to the point of ambiguity and then print out the matching files
 in the directory.</P>
<H3><A NAME="6_6_3">Automatic Inferences</A></H3>
<P>There are a small number of &quot;fixed string&quot; arguments to PyMOL
 commands. For example, in</P>
<PRE>   
   <B>PyMOL&gt;</B> show sticks
</PRE>
<P>&quot;sticks&quot; is a fixed string argument to<B> show</B>. Because there is
 only a small set of such arguments to<B> show</B>, PyMOL will infer
 your meaning even if you only provide it with a few letters. For
 example</P>
<PRE>   
   <B>PyMOL&gt;</B> show st
</PRE>
<P>works just as well.</P>
<P> Keywords are also inferred in this manner, so</P>
<PRE>   
   <B>PyMOL&gt;</B> sh st
   </PRE>
<P> works too, as long as<B> show</B> is the PyMOL only command starting
 with &quot;sh&quot;.</P>
<P>NOTE: PyMOL's command language continues to grow and develop, so it
 is important to use full-length commands and string arguments in
 scripts. Otherwise, you could not be sure that a later command or
 argument would not cause your abbreviation to become ambiguous. For
 example, &quot;sh st&quot; would no longer work if a<B> shutoff</B> command were
 added to the PyMOL language.</P>
<H2><A NAME="6_7"> Other Typed Commands and Help</A></H2>
<P> This &quot;Getting Started&quot; section used the most frequent PyMOL commands
 in very brief examples. The section titled &quot;Simple Examples&quot; shows
 other commands that combine representations, selections and property
 changes. More complicated examples appear in the section titled
 &quot;Cookbook and Complex Examples,&quot; and a comprehensive listing of typed
 commands appears in the section titled &quot;Command and API Reference.&quot;</P>
<P> To see a list of the keyword commands that are available in PyMOL on
 your computer screen, type<B> help</B> and &quot;enter&quot; (Typing TAB and
 &quot;enter&quot; will work too). Add the keyword if you want help on a
 particular command:</P>
<PRE>
SYNTAX
   
   help <I>keyword</I>
      
EXAMPLE
   
   <B>PyMOL&gt;</B> help load			
</PRE>
 PyMOL responds by displaying the manual page that discribes the command
 in the PyMOL viewer. Command line completion works inside of help, so
 if you don't remember the full keyword, type<B> help</B>, the first
 character or so of the keyword, and hit TAB. Python will display a list
 of possible help topics.
<P> Click inside the viewer and hit escape to toggle back and forth
 between the display of the manual page or the list of commands and the
 molecules you have loaded in PyMOL.</P>
<P> All the keywords that PyMOL understands are listed alphabetically
 and described in the &quot;Reference&quot; section. PyMOL commands run on top of
 the Python programming language and may contain Python statements.
 After you type in a command and hit return, PyMOL will check whether
 the first word is one of its keywords (or if it can be extended into a
 keyword). If not, PyMOL will pass the command on to the Python
 interpreter. PyMOL will return a Python error message if neither a
 PyMOL nor a Python keyword is recognized.
